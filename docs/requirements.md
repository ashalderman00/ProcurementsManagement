# Procurement Management Requirements

## Core Purchasing Priorities

- **Purchase order lifecycle is the heartbeat of the product.** Every request must seamlessly transform into a purchase order with rich tracking, change control, and auditability until the order is closed.
- **Robust catalog experiences drive compliant shopping.** Buyers and requesters rely on curated internal catalogues and vendor-managed content to select approved goods and services quickly.
- **Punchout to supplier websites is first-class.** The platform needs native punchout flows that let users shop on supplier sites and return carts without breaking the approval process.
- **Integration keeps procurement connected.** APIs, webhooks, EDI, and ERP connectors synchronize purchase orders, receipts, and invoices with the broader finance ecosystem.

## Roles and Permissions

### Finance
- **Responsibilities:** Oversee budgets and ensure that spending aligns with financial policies.
- **Permissions:** Access all approved requests and purchase orders; view financial reports; approve high-value expenditures.
- **Key Workflows:**
  - Review approved requests for budget compliance.
  - Monitor purchasing activities and expenditures.

### Requester
- **Responsibilities:** Initiate procurement requests with necessary details and justification.
- **Permissions:** Create and view their own requests; track status; edit or cancel before approval.
- **Key Workflows:**
  - Draft and submit procurement requests.
  - Follow the request through approval and purchasing stages.

### Buyer
- **Responsibilities:** Convert approved requests into purchase orders and handle vendor interactions.
- **Permissions:** Access approved requests; create and manage purchase orders; update order status.
- **Key Workflows:**
  - Select vendors and issue purchase orders.
  - Record delivery and close completed purchases.

### Approver
- **Responsibilities:** Evaluate requests for policy and budget compliance.
- **Permissions:** View pending requests; approve, reject, or request changes.
- **Key Workflows:**
  - Receive notifications for requests requiring approval.
  - Provide decisions and comments.

### Admin
- **Responsibilities:** Manage system configuration, user accounts, and role assignments.
- **Permissions:** Full system access including user and role management and audit logs.
- **Key Workflows:**
  - Create or deactivate user accounts.
  - Assign roles and adjust permissions.

## Key Workflows

### Submitting Requests
1. Requester submits a procurement request with details and justification.
2. Request is routed to an Approver for initial review.

### Approvals
1. Approver evaluates the request and may approve, reject, or return for changes.
2. Finance verifies budget availability for approved requests.

### Purchasing
1. Buyer converts an approved request into a draft purchase order. Request metadata (vendor recommendations, budget codes, ship-to/bill-to locations, and contract references) auto-populate the header while line items inherit catalogue data and requester notes.
2. Buyer reviews and enriches the purchase order by adjusting quantities, delivery schedules, or accounting splits. Supporting documents (quotes, scope statements) can be attached at both header and line levels.
3. Purchase order statuses follow a controlled lifecycle: **Draft → Pending Approval → Approved → Sent to Supplier → Partially Received → Fully Received → Closed**. Change orders produce a new revision while keeping a complete history.
4. Once approved, the system issues the purchase order via email, portal download, or EDI/cXML transmission. Buyers can resend, acknowledge supplier confirmations, and record order comments.
5. Goods receipt and service confirmation updates roll back into the purchase order, enabling three-way match readiness for Finance and highlighting variances for investigation.

## Catalogue Management

- Maintain an internal corporate catalogue with category hierarchy, preferred suppliers, contract numbers, pricing tiers, and unit of measure standards.
- Support vendor-managed catalogue feeds (CSV, cXML, API) with effective dates, price break rules, and automatic change logs that alert buyers before publishing updates.
- Allow requesters to search, filter, and compare catalogue items, mark favorites, and initiate purchase requests with pre-approved data that speeds up downstream purchase order creation.
- Provide governance controls such as draft/publish workflows, mandatory attributes, and visibility rules (by business unit, location, or cost center) so catalogue content reflects policy.

## Punchout and External Shopping

- Offer seamless punchout experiences using common protocols (cXML, OCI). Users launch supplier storefronts from within the procurement app, authenticate via SSO, and retain their identity throughout the session.
- After shopping, the supplier returns the cart to the procurement system where items are converted into line items on a requisition or directly into a draft purchase order while preserving supplier-provided item IDs, pricing, and contract references.
- Capture punchout transaction logs, timestamps, and cart details for audit trails and troubleshooting. Buyers can replay punchout carts or switch suppliers mid-process without losing the request history.

## Integration and Data Exchange

- Provide REST and GraphQL APIs for CRUD operations on purchase orders, requisitions, catalogue items, suppliers, and receipts. Include webhook callbacks for order approvals, status changes, and receipt postings.
- Deliver ERP integrations (e.g., SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics) to push approved purchase orders, synchronize vendor master data, and import goods receipt or invoice status updates.
- Support supplier integrations using standards such as EDI 850/855/856 and cXML order confirmation/ship notices to minimize manual follow-up.
- Enable scheduled exports (SFTP, cloud storage) for finance data warehouses and allow import jobs for contract price lists, account codes, and cost center hierarchies.
